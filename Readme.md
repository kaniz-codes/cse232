# Algorithms

This repository serves as a collection of **notes**, **code implementations**, **explanations**, and **learning resources** gathered while studying topics in **Algorithms and Data Structures**.

It is organized by topic and includes both theoretical concepts and practical code.

## Topics Covered (Mid-Term)

### Sorting Algorithms
- [Insertion Sort](./sort-insertion/)
- [Selection Sort](./sort-selection/)
- [Quick Sort](./sort-quick/)
- [Merge Sort](./sort-merge/)
- [Heap Sort](./sort-heap/)

### Dynamic Programming
- [0/1 Knapsack Problem](./knapsack-0-1/)
- [Rod Cutting Problem](./rod-cutting/)
- [Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)](./longest-common-subsequence/)

### Greedy Algorithms
- [Fractional Knapsack Problem](./knapsack-fractional/)
- [Huffman Coding](./huffman-coding/)
- [Activity Selection Problem](./activity-selection/)

We are following the textbook
